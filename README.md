# Scaling Node.js Services

## CascadiaFest 2015 - Michael Lanzetta

This is the slide deck I'll be presenting at [CascadiaFest 2015](http://2015.cascadiajs.com/) on the Server Day.
It's built using the PikeStreet theme (from my co-worker Felix Rieseberg) for Reveal.js, extended with Joint.js
to provide architecture diagrams.

## Talk Overview

The crux of the talk is on the [Nitrogen.io](http://nitrogen.io) IoT framework, deploying and scaling it on Azure using
 Docker, CoreOS, and Deis. Additionally, I'll endeavor to cover building a client library for parsing the binary AMQP 1.0
 protocol in Node.js and the trials and tribulations of parsing binary data in Node.
